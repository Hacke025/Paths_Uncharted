<section class="chapter">
    <h2>The Price of a Name</h2>
    <p>Div kept walking because stopping felt worse.<br><br>
The street narrowed as he moved away from the brighter avenues. The neon thinned out here-not gone, just tired. Signs buzzed instead of glowing cleanly. A restaurant’s digital board flickered between menus and static. Someone had taped a paper notice over the bottom corner, the ink already running from rain.<br><br>
Div didn’t know where he was going. He just knew the city didn’t want him standing still.<br><br>
His body reminded him of that with every step.<br><br>
The wounds had begun to ache properly now-deep, pulsing pain that spread through his ribs and down his arms. Not sharp enough to drop him, not dull enough to ignore. He adjusted his pace, favoring one side, blending into the flow of pedestrians the way instinct told him to. Shoulders down. Head slightly lowered. Don’t look lost.<br><br>
That instinct scared him.<br><br>
Why do I know how to do this?<br><br>
The city moved around him without care. People laughed, argued, bartered. A street vendor shouted about fried dough and spices. Somewhere nearby, metal clanged-someone repairing a storefront gate by hand. Just people, noise, life.<br><br>
And then him. Out of place in a way he couldn’t explain.<br><br>
He passed another digital board or screen mounted high on a building wall. News headlines scrolled slowly across it, text glowing white against a dark blue background.<br><br>
Most of it meant nothing to him.<br><br>
Until it didn’t.<br><br>
He stopped without meaning to.<br><br>
The board refreshed revealing it again.<br><br>
CONFIRMED DECEASED - DIGITAL DIV<br><br>
CASE STATUS: CLASSIFIED<br><br>
BOUNTY ACTIVE - 100,000 MARKS<br><br>
His breath caught.<br><br>
The world did not stop. People brushed past him, annoyed murmurs following when he failed to move fast enough. Div stared up at the screen, neck aching, eyes locked on the name like it might change if he looked long enough.<br><br>
Digital Div.<br><br>
The word felt foreign. Heavy. Like it belonged to someone else.<br><br>
Dead.<br><br>
“I’m not,” he whispered, but the city didn’t care.<br><br>
He stepped back, heart hammering, and nearly collided with a metal pole at the edge of the sidewalk. Someone had wrapped paper notices around it-layered, overlapping, some old enough that the edges had curled and yellowed.<br><br>
Div didn’t want to look.<br><br>
He looked anyway.<br><br>
The paper was cheap. Black ink. A printed face staring back at him.<br><br>
His face.<br><br>
Or close enough.<br><br>
This photo was grainy, taken from an angle, his expression caught somewhere between focus and irritation. His hair was longer in the image. Cleaner. His eyes looked sharper. Like they knew something.<br><br>
Below it, bold text:<br><br>
WANTED - INFORMATION OR CAPTURE<br><br>
 REWARD: 100,000 MARKS<br><br>
Div staggered back as if struck.<br><br>
“No,” he breathed.<br><br>
The pain flared again, sharp this time, as if his body agreed. He pressed a hand to the wall beside him, skin cold under his palm. His vision swam, not from blood loss, but from the weight of realization settling into his chest.<br><br>
They’re looking for me.<br><br>
Not for answers. Not for help.<br><br>
For money.<br><br>
Marks.<br><br>
He didn’t even know what a Mark was, but he knew what that number meant by the way people talked about it. By the way his instincts screamed now, louder than before.<br><br>
That much money made people reckless.<br><br>
“Hey.”<br><br>
The voice came from behind him.<br><br>
Too close.<br><br>
Div froze.<br><br>
“Sorry,” the man said casually, stepping around him. “Didn’t mean to startle you.”<br><br>
Div forced himself to breathe. Slowly. Evenly. He nodded once, not trusting his voice.<br><br>
The man didn’t leave.<br><br>
Instead, he looked up at the poster. Then back at Div.<br><br>
Something in his expression shifted-not surprise, not fear.<br><br>
Calculation.<br><br>
“You know,” the man said lightly, “you look a lot like that guy.”<br><br>
Div’s heart slammed against his ribs.<br><br>
“That happens,” Div replied, surprised at how steady his voice sounded. “Common face, I guess.”<br><br>
The man hummed. He was average height, broad shoulders, wearing a jacket with reinforced stitching-practical, not flashy. A traveler’s coat. Or a fighter’s.<br><br>
A bounty hunter’s.<br><br>
“Funny thing,” the man continued, scratching his chin. “That picture’s a few days old. And you’re bleeding.”<br><br>
Div’s muscles tensed.<br><br>
“Rough city,” Div said. He took a step sideways, angling toward the crowd. Toward noise. Toward witnesses.<br><br>
The man mirrored him effortlessly.<br><br>
“Sure is,” he said. “Mind coming with me for a second? Just a few questions.”<br><br>
There it was.<br><br>
Div’s gaze flicked past him-and caught the slightest movement near the alley entrance across the street. Another figure. Leaner. Watching.<br><br>
Two of them.<br><br>
“Questions about what?” Div asked, though he already knew.<br><br>
The man smiled.<br><br>
“About why someone declared dead is walking around my district,” he said. Then, quieter-too quiet-“And how fast I can turn that into a hundred thousand Marks.”<br><br>
The word Marks hit harder than the poster ever had.<br><br>
Div didn’t think.<br><br>
He moved.<br><br>
He shoved past the man, shoulder slamming into his chest, pain exploding up his arm as the wound protested. Someone shouted. The crowd rippled in surprise as Div bolted forward, limping but fast enough.<br><br>
“HEY!” the man barked. “That’s him!”<br><br>
The second figure lunged from the alley, but Div swerved, barely missing grasping hands. His lungs burned. His vision narrowed. He ran on instinct alone, feet pounding pavement, weaving through startled pedestrians.<br><br>
A paper poster tore free from the pole as he passed, fluttering into the street.<br><br>
His face stared up at him from the ground.<br><br>
Div didn’t slow down.<br><br>
He ran until the streets thinned. Until neon gave way to dimmer signs. Until concrete cracked and the buildings leaned closer together, shadows swallowing the light.<br><br>
When he finally stopped, doubled over and gasping, one thought cut through the pain, clean and undeniable:<br><br>
If I stay anywhere too long… someone will sell me.<br><br>
Div wiped blood from his mouth and forced himself upright.<br><br>
He didn’t know who he was.<br><br>
But the world clearly did.<br><br>
And it wanted him caught-or gone.<br><br>
So he kept moving.<br><br>
