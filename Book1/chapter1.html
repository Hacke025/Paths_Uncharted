    <h2>The Quiet After</h2>
    <p>Div woke to the sound of nothing.<br><br>
Not silence-silence implied intention. This was absence. The kind that existed only after something loud had finished breaking.<br><br>
He lay still, eyes closed, waiting for his body to tell him what had gone wrong.<br><br>
Something hummed faintly beneath him. Not mechanical, not natural-just present. The air smelled dry, metallic, and old, like a room that had been sealed and forgotten rather than abandoned. When he opened his eyes, the ceiling above him wasn’t flat. It slanted inward, fractured plates stitched together by exposed beams and cables that sagged under their own weight.<br><br>
For a moment, he assumed he was dreaming.<br><br>
That thought didn’t last.<br><br>
Pain arrived late, as if it had been waiting politely. A deep ache settled into his ribs. His shoulder throbbed. When he tried to move his hand, his fingers responded a fraction too slowly, like they had to remember how.<br><br>
Okay, he thought. That’s… not ideal.<br><br>
He pushed himself onto his elbows and immediately regretted it. The room spun just enough to make him stop. He stayed there, breathing shallowly, eyes tracing the unfamiliar shapes around him.<br><br>
The place looked damaged-but not freshly. Scorch marks stained the floor in long arcs. One wall had partially collapsed, revealing another chamber beyond it filled with debris and shadow. Whatever had happened here hadn’t happened minutes ago. Or hours.<br><br>
Time felt slippery. Like it had been torn instead of passed.<br><br>
Div frowned.<br><br>
His name came easily. Too easily. It sat in his mind like a label without context.<br><br>
Div… what?<br><br>
He waited for something else to follow. A last name. A memory. A reason he should know where he was.<br><br>
Nothing came.<br><br>
That realization landed softly, then spread.<br><br>
He searched his thoughts more carefully this time. Childhood. Family. A place that felt like home. Faces. Voices. Even the smallest, most useless detail-anything at all.<br><br>
There was only blank space.<br><br>
Panic tried to rise. He pressed it down with effort, focusing instead on what he could feel. The cold floor beneath him. The faint vibration in the structure. His breathing, uneven but steady. He was alive. Injured, maybe, but alive.<br><br>
That had to count for something.<br><br>
Div rolled onto his side and sat up slowly, bracing himself against a bent support beam. His jacket-his jacket?-hung loosely from his shoulders, scuffed and torn in places. When he checked beneath it, he found bandages. Roughly applied, but effective. Whoever had done it had known what they were doing.<br><br>
That raised another question he couldn’t answer.<br><br>
He stood carefully, testing his weight. His legs held. Barely.<br><br>
“Alright,” he muttered to himself. His voice sounded normal. Younger than he expected. “Step one: don’t fall over.”<br><br>
The sound echoed strangely, swallowed by the broken room.<br><br>
He moved toward the opening in the wall, stepping over debris and twisted metal. Beyond it, the structure opened into a narrow passage that slanted upward. Light filtered down from somewhere above-not bright, but alive. Artificial.<br><br>
A city, then.<br><br>
That idea felt right in his chest.<br><br>
As he walked, fragments of thought drifted in and out of focus. Not memories-more like impressions. That places like this existed everywhere. That cities stacked upward instead of spreading out. That technology and danger often lived too close together.<br><br>
I know things, he realized. Just not about me.<br><br>
The passage ended at a set of stairs.<br><br>
They spiraled upward in a way that made his eyes hurt to follow. Each step was slightly too tall, the curve slightly too tight, as if whoever designed them had been more concerned with function than comfort-or sanity.<br><br>
Div stared at them for a long moment.<br><br>
Up meant answers. Or trouble.<br><br>
Possibly both.<br><br>
He started climbing.<br><br>
With each step, the hum grew louder. The air warmed. By the time he reached the top, his breathing had turned shallow again, sweat clinging to his collar despite the cool metal around him.<br><br>
He pushed the hatch open.<br><br>
Light spilled in-not sunlight, but something close enough to fool the eye. Neon signs flickered overhead. Walkways crisscrossed between towering structures. People moved in steady streams, talking, laughing, arguing, living as if nothing in the world had recently gone wrong.<br><br>
Div stepped out onto the platform and stopped.<br><br>
No one looked at him.<br><br>
No alarms. No shouting. No sudden recognition.<br><br>
The world didn’t care that he had woken up empty.<br><br>
That thought unsettled him more than the ruins below ever could have.<br><br>
He moved aside, leaning against a railing as the crowd flowed past. Every face was unfamiliar. Every voice background noise. Somewhere deep inside, a quiet fear took shape-not sharp, not loud, but persistent.<br><br>
What is this place? What is happening? Who… Who am I?<br><br>
Div straightened slowly, eyes scanning the city that stretched above and below him in layered complexity. This place was vast. Old. Alive.<br><br>
And he was standing in it with no past and no idea what had nearly killed him.<br><br>
The hum of the city swallowed his thoughts as he took his first step forward.<br><br>
Somewhere out there, answers existed.<br><br>
Whether he liked what they would tell him was another question entirely.
