    <h2>The Weight of Moving</h2>
    <p>Div noticed the city before he noticed himself.<br><br>
Light came first-not blinding, not soft, just present. It leaked through gaps between buildings, bounced off glass and metal and stone. Sound followed. Voices layered over one another. Footsteps. Distant laughter. The scrape of something heavy being dragged across pavement. <br><br>
Life.<br><br>
Div stood still in the middle of it.<br><br>
He didn’t remember stopping there. He didn’t remember walking there either. One moment he was in an alley that smelled like rain and rust, the next he was surrounded by people who moved as if nothing in the world was wrong.<br><br>
Something was wrong.<br><br>
The pain arrived slowly, like a tide creeping up his body.<br><br>
At first it was just stiffness. Then pressure. Then heat.<br><br>
He sucked in a sharp breath and staggered sideways, catching himself against a stone wall. His fingers slipped slightly on the surface before gripping hard. The stone was real. Cold. Rough.<br><br>
Good, his mind whispered, unprompted. Real things don’t lie.<br><br>
His breathing grew shallow as the pain bloomed fully-deep, layered, wrong in a way he couldn’t put into words. His chest tightened. His arms trembled. When he shifted his weight, fire ripped through his side.<br><br>
“Okay,” he muttered, unsure who he was speaking to. “Okay.”<br><br>
He pulled his torn jacket aside.<br><br>
The wounds stared back at him.<br><br>
They were worse than he expected.<br><br>
Long gashes crossed his torso and arms, some jagged, others frighteningly clean, like something sharp had passed through him without resistance. There were dark bruises beneath the skin-impact marks, maybe. Bullet wounds, he realized distantly, though he didn’t remember being shot.<br><br>
They should have been bleeding more.<br><br>
They should have been infected.<br><br>
They should have been killing him.<br><br>
Instead, the skin was closing.<br><br>
Slowly. Imperfectly. Like the body was arguing with reality and refusing to lose.<br><br>
Div’s throat tightened.<br><br>
“I should be dead,” he whispered.<br><br>
The words didn’t scare him.<br><br>
That scared him more than anything else.<br><br>
Earlier-before the pain demanded his attention-he had passed two people sparring in the street.<br><br>
It hadn’t been a performance. No crowd, no cheering. Just two figures circling each other, swords flashing under the afternoon light. Plain blades. Steel on steel. The sound had rung sharp and clean through the air.<br><br>
Normal.<br><br>
Yet something about the duel had made his chest ache.<br><br>
Not envy.<br><br>
Not admiration.<br><br>
Recognition.<br><br>
His fingers twitched now, remembering a sensation he couldn’t place. Weight. Balance. Timing. As if his hands once knew exactly where to be and when to move.<br><br>
He squeezed them into fists.<br><br>
Nothing came back.<br><br>
The memory slipped away the moment he reached for it, leaving behind a dull frustration that pressed against his skull. He rubbed his temples, breathing slowly until the ache faded.<br><br>
Whatever I was, he thought, I’m not that anymore.<br><br>
Div pushed himself upright.<br><br>
His legs protested, but they held. He started walking again, unsure why. No destination. No plan. Just movement.<br><br>
Standing still felt dangerous.<br><br>
The town opened around him as he moved deeper into it. Buildings rose higher here, layered with glowing signs and flickering digital boards bolted into stone and brick. Some displays were cracked, showing static beneath the light. Others had paper notices taped over their corners-handwritten, printed, smudged.<br><br>
People talked as they passed him, voices overlapping in fragments.<br><br>
“-found a relic in the lower ruins-”<br><br>
“-government’s still lying about that raid-”<br><br>
“-heard someone almost killed a Digitization follower-”<br><br>
Div slowed.<br><br>
The word snagged on something inside him.<br><br>
Digitization.<br><br>
It felt… close. Uncomfortably so. Like a name you’d forgotten but didn’t want to hear spoken aloud.<br><br>
He shook his head and kept moving.<br><br>
A large digital board dominated the side of a building near the center of the district. News, notices, weather updates. Div stopped in front of it, drawn by the simple logic that information was better than ignorance.<br><br>
The board refreshed.<br><br>
A NEARBY TEMPLE DISCOVERED<br><br>
Experts believe it may belong to the Oceanic Path-exploration ongoing.<br><br>
LOCAL MARKET OPENS NEW ARMORY<br><br>
Relics and reinforced gear now available.<br><br>
WEATHER FORECAST<br><br>
Clear skies. No storms expected.<br><br>
Div read them slowly, absorbing what little he could. Paths. Temples. Relics. None of it meant anything yet-but it felt important.<br><br>
Then the board changed again.<br><br>
CONFIRMED DECEASED - DIGITAL DIV<br><br>
CASE STATUS: CLASSIFIED<br><br>
BOUNTY ACTIVE - 100,000 MARKS<br><br>
The world tilted.<br><br>
His pulse roared in his ears as he stared up at the text. At the name.<br><br>
Digital Div.<br><br>
Dead.<br><br>
His mouth went dry.<br><br>
“That’s…” His voice cracked. He tried again. “That’s me.”<br><br>
Or it was.<br><br>
The report blurred as his thoughts raced. Dead, but hunted. Classified, but public bounty. It didn’t make sense-and somehow, that made perfect sense.<br><br>
He backed away from the board, heart pounding, and nearly stumbled into a nearby pole plastered with paper notices.<br><br>
Wanted posters.<br><br>
He didn’t need to look. He still did though.<br><br>
The face on the paper was his-older, sharper, more certain. A version of himself that knew where he stood in the world.<br><br>
Div tore his gaze away.<br><br>
If they think I’m dead, he realized, then finding me alive changes something.<br><br>
And whatever that something was-it was worth a hundred thousand Marks.<br><br>
Div pulled his jacket tighter around himself and melted back into the crowd, fear finally catching up to him.<br><br>
He didn’t know who he was.<br><br>
But the city did.<br><br>
And it was only a matter of time before someone decided to cash him in.<br><br>
